You can install Python 3 on your machine with Anaconda, a free and easy-to-install Python distribution and a collection of open-source packages, which includes a package and environment manager.

### MATLAB/GNU Octave
MATLAB is a [licensed software](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html) by MathWorks. Please contact your Institution to verify if you have access to a license. If this is the case, you can find detailed instructions on how to install the software [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/).

Alternatively, [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free and open-source alternative to MATLAB which shares its syntax (more about compatibility at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#MATLAB_compatibility)). Installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download).
