### Overview

This is a resource for image analysis training material, with a focus on research in the life sciences. Currently, this resource is mainly meant to serve image analysis trainers, helping them to design courses. However, we might add more text (or videos) to the material such that it could also be used by students for self-directed study. Please note that this material is under constant development and help is very much appreciated. 

Please see our [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please get in touch by [writing an issue](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/issues)

### Training modules 

The material is divided into small modules, where the teaching of each module should take about 30 minutes. Each module covers a specific aspect of image analysis. At the beginning of each module there is a list of modules containing prerequisite topics. At the end of each module there are suggestions of what could be taught next. This provides trainers guidance on how to combine modules into a longer workshop. See also below for courses that have been taught already.

The modules are meant to be taught hands-on, i.e. following the teacher's guidance, students execute the relevant steps in an image analysis software on their computers. The modules provide those steps for several major image analysis platforms, such as ImageJ GUI, ImageJ Macro, Python and Galaxy.

### Example courses 

The above training modules have been used in various contexts and compiled into various courses ([see here for past courses](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/tree/master/courses)). Below is a selection of consolidated courses that have been taught multiple times already.
