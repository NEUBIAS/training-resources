title:     Output saving
layout:    module
tags: ["scripting"]
prerequisites:
  - "[Binarize an image](../binarization)"
  - "[Connected components labeling](../connected_components)"
  - "[Simple 2D object analysis](../workflow_segment_2d_nuclei_measure_shape)"
  - "Generating results tables"
  - "Defining regions of interest (ROIs)"

objectives:
  - "Save measurements as a table"
  - "Save ROIs"
  - "Save output label mask"

motivation: |
  There are multiple situations in which you need to save the different types of output you can generate with FIJI. For example, you may want to save your results tables for further analysis in other software (e.g. RStudio, MS EXCEL, ..). It can also be important to save the ROIs that were used for particular measurements, so that you can look back at them for reference, or to use them for visualization purposes. In addition to ROIs, images can be saved as label masks to store the information about different regions. Finally, you may also want to save your entire script containing particular settings or parameters that you used, so that you have re-run the analysis with the exact same settings or compare it with the results obtained using different settings.

  - In the IJ Macro or Jython script, specify your output directory by pasting a string containing the path to the directory (for example r'C:\Users\UserName\Desktop' on Windows or '/Users/UserName/Desktop/' on MacOS).
  - Open the blobs image (File > Open Samples > Blobs).
  - Binarize it and run the 'analyze particles' command to generate different kinds of output.
  - Save the different output types.

  ### Fill in the blanks

    - Three commonly saved data output types include  ___ .
    - In order to safely re-open your data or open it in different software, you need to save in an ____ file format.

    > ## Solution
    >   - Three commonly saved data output types include **results tables, ROI sets, and label masks**.
    >   - In order to safely re-open your data or open it in different software, you need to save in an **interoperable** file format.
    {: .solution}

  ### True or False
    - Label masks should be saved in JPEG format.
    - Tab-delimited text is a decent output format for results tables.

    > ## Solution
    >   - Label masks should be saved in JPEG format. **False** (JPEG compression results in loss of the unique label values in the image)
    >   - Tab-delimited text is a decent output format for results tables. **True** (this is generally more stable in other software than for example comma-delimited data)
