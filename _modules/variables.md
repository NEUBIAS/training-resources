title:     Variables
layout:    module
tags: ["scripting"]
prerequisites:
 - "[Running a script](../script_run)"
objectives:
  - "Variables name, value, type, and storage"
  - "How to use variables in functions"
motivation: |
  A variable is an essential concept in programming, it allows to structure and generalize a script/program.
  A variable stores a value, e.g. a numeric or string value, that can be used and changed at several occasions in 
  a script.

figure_legend: Variables are containers specific for an information type. The name of the variable should explain its purpose. Naming convention is camelCase (left side) or under_score (right side).

activity_preface: |
  - Open a script editor, create two numeric variables, store results of addition in a new variable.
  - Show how a variable can be used in a simple function (e.g. print(variable)) and in a image processing function.
