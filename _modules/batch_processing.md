title: Batch processing
layout: module
tags: ["scripting"]
prerequisites:
  - "[Working with strings](../string_concat)"
  - "[For loops](../script_for_loop)"
objectives:
  - "Automatically process a number of images"
motivation: |
  Scientific discovery is based on reproducibility. Thus, it is very common to apply the same analysis workflow to a number of images, possibly comprising different biological conditions. To achieve this, it is very important to know how to efficiently "batch process" many images.
