### ImageJ/Fiji

We recommend installing Fiji, which is a distribution of ImageJ which includes many useful plugins.

You can find instructions on how to install Fiji on your machine [here](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads).

Further information on plugins and their installation can be found [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/).

### Napari

Instructions on how to install Napari can be found [at this link](https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

### Python

You can install Python 3 on your machine with Anaconda, a free and easy-to-install Python distribution and a collection of open-source packages, which includes a package and environment manager.

Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found on [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) and in the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/).

### MATLAB/GNU Octave
MATLAB is a [licensed software](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html) by MathWorks. Please contact your Institution to verify if you have access to a license. If this is the case, you can find detailed instructions on how to install the software [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/).

Alternatively, [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free and open-source alternative to MATLAB which shares its syntax (more about compatibility at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#MATLAB_compatibility)). Installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download).
