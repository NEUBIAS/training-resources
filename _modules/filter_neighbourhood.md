title:     Neighbourhood filters
layout:    module
prerequisites:
  - "[Basic properties of images and pixels](../pixels)"
  - "[Binarization](../binarization)"

objectives:
  - Understand the basic principle of a neighbourhood filter.
  - Apply a mean filter to an image.

motivation: >
  Images are quite often noisy or have other issues that make them hard to segment, e.g. by means of a simple intensity threshold. Neighbourhood filters are a very important (maybe the most important) means to enhanced images in a sense of making them more amendable for segmentation.

### Neighbourhood filters

Neighborhood filters comprise two ingredients: a definition of the pixel neighbourhood (size and shape) and a mathematical recipe what to compute on this neighbourhood. 
The result of this computation will be used to replace the value of the central pixel in the neighbourhood. This procedure can be applied to several (all) pixels of an image 
to obtain a filtered image. The animation shows a square neighbourhoods (3x3) applied to the inner pixels of the image. 

There are really tons of different neighborhood filters, and you can invent a new one!

#### The neighbourhoods 

The neighborhood of a pixel is also called a structuring element and can have various sizes and shapes.
Here, we use one of the simplest and most widely used neighbourhoods, namely a circular neighborhood, which is defined by a certain radius. We will explore other shapes of structuring elements in more detail in a dedicated module.

#### The math

There are really many many ways how to cleverly compute on a pixel neighborhood. For example, one class of computations is called convolutional filters, another is called rank filters. Here, we focus on the relatively simple mean filter, which is the mean filter.

#### Best practice

As usual, everything depends one the scientific question, but maybe one could say to use a filter that changes the image as little as possible.
