title:     Loops
layout:    module
tags: ["scripting"]
objectives:
  - "Use for loops to repeat operations multiple times"
  - "Running a script for multiple files"
  
motivation: |
  In an imaging processing workflow you often apply the same operation to several images, several labels, etc. In order to avoid repeating the same code many times we can use control flow statements such as a `for` loop. Loops together with `if` clauses represent extremely useful tools when programming.

activity_preface: |
  - Open a script editor.
  - Open and run a script that contains several repeated operations and explain that you would like to write this part of code in a more simple way. 
  - Explain the different elements of a numeric `for` loop:
    - The loop header, the loop counter/variable, and body
    - The initial and end condition
    - How the counter is iterated (e.g. `i++`).
  - Using a print command show how the iterator changes
  - Take the starting script and modify it using a `for` loop

 ### Multiple erosion
  * Open the binary image [xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyc_16bit__nup_nuclei/xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif)
  * Create a macro (or use a pre-defined one) to erode and find boundary of the binary objects
  * Modify the macro so that you can perform an arbitrary number of erosions and find their boundary

#### For loop
A `for` loop occurs by iterating over a loop variable defined in a loop header. You use `for` loops when you know the number of iterations to execute.


#### While loop
While loop does not have a fixed number of iterations. Typically the header contains a condition that is computed within the body of the loop.
