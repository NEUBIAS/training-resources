# Bioimage data handling and inspection

## Why take this course

For microscopy based scientific discovery it is critical to be able to quantitatively understand and inspect bioimaging data. This is important at many stages, ranging from looking at the data yourself and learning about scientific data handling practices.

This course will teach this using Fiji.

## Target audience

Scientists that may use microscopy data in their research.

## Prerequisites

* No computational skills are required
* Computer with Fiji installed
* Internet access

### Timing

Available time: 10 hrs = 600 minutes; two 1 hour lunch break, four 20 minutes coffee break => 400 minutes total
Number of modules: 10
Thus, average time per module: 400 min / 10 = 40 minutes roughly plus 30 minutes close up session
