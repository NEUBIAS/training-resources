# Image analysis course for beginners

## Why take this course

In this one-day course, you will be introduced to simple image analysis tasks on multiple images in a batch. You will learn how to record a macro for the image analysis tasks performed in ImageJ GUI. You will also learn how to analyse many images automatically in a batch using the recorded macro. Since ImageJ GUI is widely used by life scientists to perform their image analysis tasks, this course will enable them to use their image analysis pipeline in an automated way for analysis of multiple images in a batch.

## Prerequisites

- Fiji (with MorpholibJ plugin)


## Schedule

The course is comprised of:

## Trainers and organisers

- Christian Tischer (EMBL)
- Arif Khan (EMBL)


## Teaching content

The whole course will be guided hands-on sessions.

1. Welcome & trainer introduction
