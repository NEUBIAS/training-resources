# Basics of Bioimage Analysis

## Modules


### Essentials 

9:30 - 12:30 - 30min break ~ 2.5 hours = 150 min ~ 25 minutes per module  

This could be a nice one-day schedule!

0. General setup and introduction
1. image_pixels.md (just mention pixel calibration, set to 1,1!) but don't do the actual module!)
2. pixel_calibration.md (leave out)
3. image_display.md 
4. pixel_data_types.md
5. pixel_processing.md

13:30 - 16:00 - 20min break = 130 min => also around 25 minutes per module

6. binarization.md
7. connected_components.md
8. measure_shapes.md
9. measure_intensities.md (Conceptual and using MLJ)
11. basic_image_analysis_workflow.md (do it including manual background subtraction)




13. local_background_subtraction.md ( use median-based with auto-phagosome example )



10. filter_neighbourhood.md

## Local background subtraction
 
12. filter_rank.md ( use median filter with two noisy squares example )
13. local_background_subtraction.md ( use median-based with auto-phagosome example )
14. filter_morphological.md ( also show how to compute an edge of an object )

## Distance transform

15. distance_transform.md
