# Bioimage data handling and inspection

## Why take this course

For microscopy based scientific discovery it is critical to be able to quantitatively understand and inspect bioimaging data. This is important at many stages, ranging from looking at the data yourself and learning about scientific data handling practices.

This course will teach this using Fiji.

## Target audience

Scientists that may use microscopy data in their research.

## Prerequisites

* No computational skills are required
* Computer with Fiji installed
* Internet access

## Dates

## Morning session teaching content

1. [Scientfic image data presentation](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/image_inspection_and_presentation/index.html)
    - Only discuss the main figure for motivation of the course: to create the figure all the below modules need to be learned
1. [Digital image basics](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/pixels/index.html)
1. [Image data types](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/datatypes/index.html)
1. [Lookup tables](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/lut/index.html)
1. [Multichannel images](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/multichannel_images/index.html)
1. [Spatial image calibration](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/spatial_calibration/index.html)
1. [Image file formats](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/image_file_formats/index.html)
1. [Scientfic image data presentation](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/image_inspection_and_presentation/index.html)
    - Now we are ready to perform the module activity and create the scientific image presentation

### Timing

Available time: 7 hrs = 420 minutes; 1 hour lunch break, two 20 minutes coffee break => 320 minutes total
Number of modules: 9
Thus, average time per module: 320 min / 9 = 30 minutes roughly plus 30 minutes close up session
