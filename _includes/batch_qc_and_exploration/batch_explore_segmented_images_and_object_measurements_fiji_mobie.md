- Open Fiji with the [MoBIE update site installed](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
- Use MoBIE to inspect segmented nuclei and nuclei measurements
- [ Plugins › MoBIE › Open › Open Image and Labels... ]
   - Image URI: [ Browse ] to `Well_1_C0.tif` and then, to open all wells, replace `_1_` by `_.*_` such that it reads `.../Well_.*_C0.tif`
   - Label Mask URI: [ Browse ] to `Well_1_nuclei_labels.tif` and, as above, replace `_1_` by `_.*_`
   - Label Mask Table URI: [ Browse ] to `Well_1_nuclei.txt` and, as above, replace `_1_` by `_.*_`
   - SpatialCalibration: Does not matter here, because the images are only in pixel units anyway
   - Grid: Transformed (Stitched performs better if you have >100 images)
   - Click [ OK ]
- The MoBIE UI and BigDataViewer will open allowing you to conveniently browse all data
- Browsing suggestions:
   - Sort the nuclei table by `AreaShape_Area` and browse to the largest and smallest nuclei, as those are likely representing segmentation errors
   - In the table, use "Color by Column", select a measurement and color it using the blue-white-red LUT
