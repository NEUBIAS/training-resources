<h4 id="segmented_images_and_measurements"><a href="#segmented_images_and_measurements">Batch explore segmented images and object measurements</a></h4>

This activity will show how to efficiently batch explore, potentially many, segmented images and the corresponding object measurements.

Please [download the example data](https://github.com/tischi/cellprofiler-practical-NeuBIAS-Lisbon-2017/archive/refs/heads/mobie.zip) (including the CellProfiler pipeline used to create the segmentations and object measurements).

After unzipping, the data for this activity can be found in the `batch_qc_practical` sub-folder.
