- Open Fiji with the [MoBIE update site installed](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
- Open `All_Wells_cells.txt` and identify the columns that contain file names, as those will be needed to open the table with MoBIE
- [ Plugins › MoBIE › Open › Open Table... ]
   - Table Path: [ Browse ] to `All_Wells_cells.txt`
   - Image Path Column(s): `FileName_DNA, FileName_PLA`
   - Labels Path Column(s): `FileName_CellLabels, FileName_PLALabels`
   - Data Root Folder: [ Browse ] to data folder
   - SpatialCalibration: Does not matter as everything is in pixel units
   - Grid: Transformed (Stitched performs better if you have >100 images)
   - Click [ OK ]
- The MoBIE UI and BigDataViewer will open allowing you to conveniently browse all data
- Browsing suggestions:
   - Cell table: `Color > Color by Column`: `Children_PLA_dots_Count` with `blueWhiteRed` LUT
      - This will paint cells red that have a lot of PLA spots
   - Image table: `Color > Color by Column`: `Mean [Object Number]` with `blueWhiteRed` LUT
      - This will outline images red that have a lot of cells
