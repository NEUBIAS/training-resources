   - Image URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--raw.tif` and then, to open all data, replace the text in the filename before `--raw.tif` by `.*` such that it reads `.../.*--raw.tif` (do not change the folder names)
   - Label Mask URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--tracking-oids.h5` and, as above, change the path to `.../.*--tracking-oids.h5`
   - Label Mask Table URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--tracking-table.csv` and, as above, change the path to `.../.*--tracking-table.csv`
