- Open Fiji with the [MoBIE update site installed](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
- Download example data: TODO: Currently too large...
- [ Plugins › MoBIE › Open › Open Image and Labels... ]
   - Image URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--raw.tif` and then, to open all data, replace the text in the filename before `--raw.tif` by `.*` such that it reads `.../.*--raw.tif` (do not change the folder names)
   - Label Mask URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--tracking-oids.h5` and, as above, change the path to `.../.*--tracking-oids.h5`
   - Label Mask Table URI: [ Browse ] to a file ending with `--tracking-table.csv` and, as above, change the path to `.../.*--tracking-table.csv`
   - SpatialCalibration: `UsePixelUnits`; this is important, because the raw.tif images are calibrated, but, unfortunately, ilastik does not persist this calibration in the output data.
   - Grid: `Transformed`
   - Click [ OK ]
- The MoBIE UI and BigDataViewer will open allowing you to conveniently browse all data
- Browsing suggestions
   - Table menu: Color by Column: `lineage_id` with `glasbey`
