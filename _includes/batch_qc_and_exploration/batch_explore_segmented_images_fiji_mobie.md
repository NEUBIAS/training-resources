- Open Fiji with the [MoBIE update site installed](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
- Open `Well_1_C0.tif` and `Well_1_nuclei_labels.tif` in Fiji
  - Optional: Change the LUT for the labels to `glasbey_inverted`
- Check for segmentation errors
- Appreciate that manually inspecting all nuclei segmentations like this would be tedious 
- Close the two images in Fiji
- Now use MoBIE to open all images and segmentations
- [ Plugins › MoBIE › Open › Open Image and Labels... ]
   - Image URI: [ Browse ] to `Well_1_C0.tif` and then, to open all wells, replace `_1_` by `_.*_` such that it reads `.../Well_.*_C0.tif`
   - Label Mask URI: [ Browse ] to `Well_1_nuclei_labels.tif` and, same as above, replace `_1_` by `_.*_`
   - Label Mask Table URI: Leave empty
   - SpatialCalibration: Does not matter here, because the images are only in pixel units anyway
   - Grid: Transformed (Stitched performs better if you have >100 images)
   - Click [ OK ]
- The MoBIE UI and BigDataViewer will open allowing you to conveniently browse all data
- Browsing suggestions
   - Use [ Ctrl L ] to shuffle the nuclei label colors
   - Use the table to move between images
   - Table Menu: Table > Add text column, call it "Notes" and add comments while browsing through the table
   - Explore the MoBIE layers UI, e.g.
      - Fit to page button
      - Toggle layers on and off
      - Change the labels layer opacity
