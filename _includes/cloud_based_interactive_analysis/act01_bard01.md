We will use the BARD desktop EMBL instance.

- Access the BARD Desktop
    - Go to the [BARD](https://bard-external.embl.de)
    - Click `Connect with EMBL Guest Account`.
        - You will be given login details beforehand.
        - Username is `trainingXX`, replace XX with your own number.
        - Default password is `123`, you will be prompt to change it at your first log in.
    - After successful log in, you should see your desktop in your browser.
        - At the bottom of your desktop is the application dock. We keep multiple versions of software on BARD, but only the latest is shown in this dock.
        - To access older versions, click the application menu on the top right corner. `Application -> Development`
        - Each application is in its own container and independent of each other.
        - All applications start as the current logged-in user.
        - Your home directory is shared among all containers, which means if you need data accessible for all applications, you will need to store them in your own home folder.
