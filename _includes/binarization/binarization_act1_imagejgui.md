- Find and apply a threshold
  - Open [xy_8bit__two_cells.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_cells.tif)
  - Set binary options: **[Process > Binary > Options ..]** 
    - [X] Black background
  - Inspect pixel values to find a threshold separating fore- and background
    - Hover over the image and observe the pixel values in ImageJ status bar
    - Draw line profile and **[Analyze > Plot Profile ]** or **[Ctrl-K]**
    - Inspect histogram using **[Analyze > Histogram]** or **[Ctrl-H]**
      - If you do this for the whole image the background peak dominates the histogram
      - Draw a ROI on the image such that there is 50/50 foreground and background
  - Interactively find and apply a threshold
    - **[Image > Adjust > Threshold...]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-T]**
      - [X] Dark Background
      - Upper slider is lower threshold level, which is the value that you observed in the aforementioned step that would separate foreground and background
      - Lower slide is the upper threshold level. This can be set to the maximum value of the bit depth (in this case 255)
      - Press `Apply` to create a binary image
  - Appreciate that the binary image only has two values: 0 and 255
  - Repeat the operation so that only the brightest cell remains visible
