<h4 id="spots"><a href="#spots">Threshold nuclei and intra-nuclear speckles</a></h4>

- Open [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif)
- Apply a threshold value such that there are two foreground nuclei
- Apply a higher threshold such that is only one foreground nucleus
- Apply an even higher threshold such that only the intra-nuclear speckles are foreground
- Optionally, also find a threshold interval so that only the boundaries of the nuclei remain
