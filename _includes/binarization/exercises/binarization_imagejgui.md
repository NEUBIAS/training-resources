Open image [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif) and
1. Find a threshold value so that there are 2 foreground nuclei.
2. Find a threshold value so that only the bright dots remain
3. Find threshold interval so that only the boundary of the nuclei remains.
