- Open a [sample multichannel image](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyc_16bit__cell_dna_mts_actin.tif)
- Use the channel tools `Image > Color > Channel Tools` and set use following settings 
  - _Note:_ Composite: [x] - Channel 1, [x] Channel 2, [x] Channel 3
- Check the image data type using `Image > Type`. It is 16-bit. Convert it into RGB by selecting `Image > Type > RGB Color`. This will create a second image with the title `xyc_16bit__cell_dna_mts_actin.tif (RGB)`. 
- Use `File > Save As > Tiff` to save as a 8-bit RGB TIFF. This image can be loaded for example into a presentation.
- Next we create an image montage of all single channels (gray) and the composite RGB image.
- Go to the original image `xyc_16bit__cell_dna_mts_actin.tif` or reopen it if needed.
- Use the `Image > Color > Channel Tools` and change from `Composite` to `Grayscale`
- Make a montage with  `Image > Stack > Make Montage ...` and following parameters: `Columns = 3, Rows = 1, scale factor = 1`. Note that the montage is transformed to a RGB.
- Combine the two RGB images, single channel montage and merged color image respectively, to a final image, `Image > Stacks > Tools > Combine`.
- Add a scale bar ` Analyze › Tools › Scale Bar...`
- Use `File > Save As > Tiff` to save as a TIFF.
