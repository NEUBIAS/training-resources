  - Open a [sample multichannel image](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyc_16bit__cell_dna_mts_actin.tif)
    - This is a 16-bits/channel composite color image of HeLa cells with stained dna,  microtubules and actin respectively. Image courtesy of Monica Gobran, MPI-NAT, GÃ¶ttingen.
  - Adjust the contrast and save the composite image as RGB (JPEG/PNG/...)
  - Create a tiled image with single channels (gray look up table) and the composite. This is a typical way to represent the different channels. 
  - Save image for embedding in presentation or figures (JPEG/RGB/...)
