* Open [xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif)
* Perform an erosion
* Subtract eroded image from binary image and discuss the results. This operation is sometime called internal gradient
* If applicable show where the morphological gradient runs as a single command
