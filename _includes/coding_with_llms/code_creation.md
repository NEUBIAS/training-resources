<h4 id="create_code_llm"><a href="#create_code_llm">Create code using a LLM</a></h4>

Ask an LLM to create code that implements a bioimage analysis task.

Activities that could be solved using a LLM:
- [Threshold an image](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/binarization/index.html#brightdim)  
- [Segment nuclei and measure their shape](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/workflow_segment_2d_nuclei_measure_shape/index.html#2dnuclei)

Fixing errors:
- If you get an error executing the code, create a new prompt with this error and ask the LLM to fix it.

Understanding the code:
- If you do not understand parts of the code, ask the LLM to explain them to you.
