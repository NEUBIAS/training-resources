Create OME-Zarr data from data stored in monolithic file formats.

- Download the tiff [image series](https://zenodo.org/records/14641498/files/tiff_series.zip?download=1) and extract them to a convenient local directory.
For example: `~/image_data_course/data/tiff/tiff_series`

- Open the files
    - Observe that the files are the z sections of the same 3D image.
- Convert the files to OME-Zarr independently and as a single group
- Inspect the OME-Zarr
