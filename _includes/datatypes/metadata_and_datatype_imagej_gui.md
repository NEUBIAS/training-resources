- Download any of the above images
- Open the image using `Plugins > Bio-Formats > Bio-Formats Importer`
    - Select `[X] Display OME-XML metadata`
    - Click `[ OK ]`
- Check whether the information in `Image > Type` is the same as the one mentioned in the displayed metadata (look for `SignificantBits` and `Type`)
- Also check the maximum value in the image, e.g. using `Analyze > Histogram`
- How does this maximum value compare to the image datatype?
    - For example, you may find a value of 4095, which is the maximum of an unsigned integer 12-bit image, which may be the datatype mentioned in the image metadata, however ImageJ may represent this image as a 16-bit image. Appreciate that this can be confusing!
    - If you find the maximum of the image to be identical to maximum that the datatype of the image can represent you may have an issue with saturation! Check this
      - by hovering with the mouse over bright regions
      - using the `HiLo` LUT with appropriate contrast settings, i.e. the maximum should be the maximum of your datatype!
