<h4 id="datatype_metadata"><a href="#datatype_metadata">Explore image data types</a></h4> 

Explore the datatypes of images! 

Observe that for some software the datatype of the loaded image **does not match** the datatype given in the metadata.

The reason is that some software only support data types where the bit depth is a multiple of 8. For example, unsigned integer 12-bit data may not be supported. 

This is very important as you may misinterpret whether your image contains saturated pixels or not.
