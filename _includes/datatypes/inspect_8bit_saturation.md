Saturation, i.e. pixel value at the upper end of the datatype, is a typical problem in fluorescence microscopy images.

- Open [xy_8bit__nuclei_intensity_clipping_issue_a.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_intensity_clipping_issue_a.tif)
- Observe that this is an 8-bit image with saturation issues, i.e. many pixels of value 255
