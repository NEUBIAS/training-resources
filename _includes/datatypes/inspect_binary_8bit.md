<h4 id="binary_8bit"><a href="#binary_8bit">Inspect a binary image</a></h4> 

This activity shows that correctly handling binary images can be tricky because there typically is no dedicated binary datatype for storing images on disk.

- Open [xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif)
- Observe that this an unsigend 8-bit integer image, where only two of the possible 256 gray values used. Thus, in practice this probably represents a binary image.
