### Create a for loop
- Open a script editor.
- Open and run a script that contains several repeated operations and explain that you would like to write this part of code in a more simple way. 
- Explain the different elements of a numeric `for` loop:
- The loop header, the loop counter/variable, and body
- The initial and end condition
- How the counter is iterated (e.g. `i++`).
- Using a print command show how the iterator changes
- Take the starting script and modify it using a `for` loop
