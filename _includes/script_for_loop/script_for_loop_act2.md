  * Open the binary image [xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyc_16bit__nup_nuclei/xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif)
  * Create a macro (or use a pre-defined one) to erode and find boundary of the binary objects
  * Modify the macro so that you can perform an arbitrary number of erosions and find their boundary
