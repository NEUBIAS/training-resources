<h4 id="configure_luts"><a href="#configure_luts">Display several images with same LUT settings</a></h4>

Display image sets with the same gray scale LUT and the same contrast settings. 
Visualise the LUT as an inset in both images (you may also attempt to visualise the LUT only once outside the images).
This is what one typically should do for a presentation or publication for data that were acquired with the same microscope settings.

##### Example data

- Collagen secretion
