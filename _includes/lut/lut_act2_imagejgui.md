- Open one of the above pairs of images
- Choose a suitable LUT using `Image › Lookup Tables ›  ... `
- Adjust brightness and contrast in one image using `Image › Adjust › Brightness/Contrast...`
  - To avoid intensity clipping one typically sets the contrast on the brightest image (this may depend on your scientific question though...)
  - To find out which image is brighter you can try to use `Analyze > Histogram` 
- Use the `Set` button in `Image › Adjust › Brightness/Contrast...` and check `[X] Propagate to all other open images`
- Visualise the current LUT as an inset in both images using `Analyze › Tools › Calibration Bar...`
    - Export the image using `Plugins › BioVoxxel Figure Tools › Export SVG` (requires BioVoxxel update site)
        - SVG preserves the rendering of the scale bar at different zoom levels.
