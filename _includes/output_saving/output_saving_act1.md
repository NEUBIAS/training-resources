### Save file outputs
  - Open and run the template script available in the dropdown menu below.
  - Understand what the commands do.
  - Save the output manually and use the ImageJ recorder function to record the steps.
  - Edit the template script using the recorded commands.
  - Optional: define an output directory as a parameter and use string concatenation to specify where to save the file and with what name. An example output directory could be 'C:\\\Users\\\username\\\Desktop' on Windows (note double "\\" because a single "\\" is interpreted as an escape character) or '/Users/username/Desktop/' on MacOS.
