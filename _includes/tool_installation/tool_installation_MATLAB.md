### Install MATLAB or GNU Octave

- MATLAB is a [licensed software](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html) by MathWorks. Please contact your Institution to verify if you have access to a license. If this is the case, you can find detailed instructions on how to install the software [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/).
- Alternatively, [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free and open-source alternative to MATLAB which shares its syntax (more about compatibility at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#MATLAB_compatibility)). Installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download).
