### Explore dimensions in a 3D image

  - Open the 3D image [xyz_8bit__chromsomes.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__chromosomes.tif).
    - The data shows chromosomes wrapped around a spherical(!) nucleus; i.e. the data should look similar from all directions.
    - View the data in XY, YZ, and XZ.
    - Is the image calibrated?
    - Observe that the rendering in XZ and YZ is deformed without taking the calibration into account.
