Open these images, cells stained for their nuclei (Hoechst, 1st channel) and actin (phalloidin, 2nd channel): 
 - [xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_01.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/shading_tiling/xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_01.tif)

Do you notice a pattern of intensity difference from the center to the corner in all images?
How does this affect your intensity measurements?

Open [xy_16bit__homogeneous_slide.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/shading_tiling/xy_16bit__homogeneous_slide.tif). This image has been recorded with a an homogeneous fluorescent slide on the same setup. Show how the intensity pattern matches the pattern observed when measuring the biological sample. The intensity pattern is a typical pattern observed in widefield system and gaussian illumination.
