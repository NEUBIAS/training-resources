## Inspect shading artefact in a fluorescence image

 - Drag and drop [xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_01.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/shading_tiling/xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_01.tif)
 to ImageJ
 - Draw a line across the diagonal of the image
 - Plot a profile  `Ctrl-K` [ Analyze › Plot Profile] 
 - Press `Live` in the Plot window
 - Change between channels and also on different lines across the image
 - You should notice a difference in intensities between the center and border of the image?
 - Drag and drop [xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_02.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/shading_tiling/xyc_16bit__hoechst_phalloidin_tile_02.tif)
 to ImageJ 
 - Repeat the operation and show that one has a similar result
 - Drag and drop [xy_16bit__homogeneous_slide.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/shading_tiling/xy_16bit__homogeneous_slide.tif)
 to ImageJ
 - Discuss the pattern and how it matches what is observed with the biological sample
