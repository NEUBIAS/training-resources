<h4 id="open"><a href="#open">Explore various image file formats</a></h4>

- Open different image file formats and inspect their pixel data and also their metadata
- Appreciate that image file formats
  - include more or less metadata
  - may contain multiple images
  - may consist of multiple files, e.g. splitting metadata and pixel data across two files

##### Example image data

- [Nuclei - TIFF with minimal metadata](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_PLK1_control.tif)
- [Collagen  - Molecular Devices TIFF with extensive metadata](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_16bit__collagen.md.tif)
- [LIF containing two images with extensive metadata](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_xyc__two_images.lif)
- [CZI containing several images](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz__multiple_images.czi)
- ICS/IDS
  - [ICS metadata](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ics)
  - [IDS pixel data](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ids) 
- XML/HDF5 
  - [XML metadata](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.xml) 
  - [HDF5 pixel data](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.h5)
