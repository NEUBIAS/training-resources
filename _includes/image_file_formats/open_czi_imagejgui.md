- Open the file mentioned in the activity using:
  - [Plugins > Bio-Formats > Bio-Format Importer]
    - [X] Display metadata
    - [X] Display OME-XML Metadata
  - Press [OK]
  - Select both "Series"
  - Look at the images
  - Inspect the metadata
- Note that opening the CZI file via drag and drop also triggers the Bio-Formats plugin; this is not always the case(!); this is only true if ImageJ itself does not want to open the image itself (see the above activity about TIFF files where this can become confusing).
