	- Explore different min and max values
		- To highlight bright regions keep the `Maximum` at 255 and slide the `Minimum` bar towards right until you see very bright regions e.g., `Minimum` = `130`
  		- To highlight dull regions keep the `Minimum` at 0 and slide the `Maximum` bar towards left until you highlight very dim regions e.g., `Minimum` = `130`
