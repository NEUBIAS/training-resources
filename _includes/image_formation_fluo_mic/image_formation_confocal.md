- Open the [zebrafish embryo confocal image](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzc_8bit__zebrafish_HisGFP_LyntdTomato.tif)
- Inspect the image along various axes and appreciate the following:
  - Membranes appear with more contrast if they run along the optical axis
  - Signal intensities become weaker to in the specimen's interior, due to scattering and absorption
- Appreciate the cell segmentation (and morphometry) in the specimen interior are challenging/impossible
- Appreciate that intensity quantifications under such circumstances are highly challenging/impossible
