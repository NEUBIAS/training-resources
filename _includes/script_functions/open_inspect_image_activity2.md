<h4 id="open_image"><a href="#open_image">Open an image using a function</a></h4>

Implement the following steps:
  - Open an image from a path
  - Check the data type of the image
  - Calculate the minimum/maximum pixel values
  - Display the image

And then wrap these steps into a function that can be called for multiple images (i.e., image paths).
