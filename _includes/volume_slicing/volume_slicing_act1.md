<h4 id="2d"><a href="#2d">Create slice views of a 3D image</a></h4>
- Open a 3D image, e.g.,
  - [xyz_16bit_calibrated__dna_metaphase.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit_calibrated__dna_metaphase.tif)
- Create slice views of the 3D volume in XY, XZ, and YZ planes
- Appreciate and deal with anisotropic voxels sizes
- Optionally also create slice views at non-orthogonal planes
