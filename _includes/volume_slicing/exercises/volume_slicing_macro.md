- Open the multidimensional image [xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif).
- Reslice the image from different directions, such that you can view the image stack from the side, from the top, and from the front.
- How do you think one could see the head from 3/4 view? Tip: there is a function called ‘rotate’ in ImageJ ([Image > Transform > Rotate]).

> ## Solution
> ```
>// This macro opens the head image stack and reslices it to view it from different angles (side, top, front, and 3/4 view)
>// Close other open images
>run("Close All");
>
>// open head image stack
>open("http://imagej.net/images/t1-head.zip");
>rename("Head viewed from the side");
>
>// Reslice the head image stack to view the head from the top and from the side
>run("Reslice [/]...", "output=1.500 start=Top"); // view head from the top
>rename("Head viewed from the top");
>run("Reslice [/]...", "output=1.500 start=Left"); // view head from the front
>rename("Head viewed from the front");
>
>// Rotate the head stack that is viewed from the top and reslice to obtain 3/4 view
>selectWindow("Head viewed from the top");
>run("Duplicate...", "duplicate");
>run("Rotate... ", "angle=45 grid=1 interpolation=Bilinear enlarge stack"); // rotate the stack
>run("Reslice [/]...", "output=1.500 start=Top");
>rename("Head in 3/4 view");
>
>run("Tile");
> ```
