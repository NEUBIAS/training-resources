- Open a 3D image
- Use `Image > Properties` to check for anisotropic voxel sizes
- Use `Image > Stacks > Orthogonal views` to view the data in XY, XZ and YZ planes 
- Understand how the anisotropy is dealt with
- Use `Image > Stacks > Reslice` to resample the data, exploring the below options for dealing with anisotropy
  - `Output spacing`
  - `[ ] avoid interpolation`, if this is checked, `Output spacing` is ignored
- Use the line tool to draw a line ROI and again use `Image > Stacks > Reslice` to resample along this line
- Slice the data at arbitrary angles using `Plugins > BigDataViewer > Open Current Image]`
  - `Shift-X/Y/Z`: slice along x,y,z.
  - `Left button drag`: slice along arbitray plane
  - `I`: toggle interpolation
