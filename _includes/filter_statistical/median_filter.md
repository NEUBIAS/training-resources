<h4 id="median"><a href="#median">Median filter exploration</a></h4>

Explore the effect of the median filter on various example images. Explore how changing the size (structural element) of the filter affects the result.

Example images:

- [xy_8bit_binary__squares_different_size.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__squares_different_size.tif)
    - Observe how the median filter can remove small objects while preserving edges of larger objects.
- [xy_8bit_binary__large_spot.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__large_spot.tif)
    - Observe that the median filter is not edge-preserving for curved edges.
- [xy_8bit__two_noisy_squares_different_size.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_noisy_squares_different_size.tif)
    - Observe how the median behaves in the prescence of noise.
- [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif)
    - Observe how the median filter can remove small internal structure from larger objects.
- [xy_8bit_binary__test_structures.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__test_structures.tif)
    - Observe how the median filter behaves for binary images.
