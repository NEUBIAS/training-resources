- Open one of the example images 
- Resize the image by zooming in and out, using the arrow up and down keys
  - Appreciate that this does not change the data: number of pixels and pixel calibration stays the same (`Image > Properties`)
  - Optionally copy the image at different zoom levels into PowerPoint using `Edit > Copy to System`
    - Notice that the zoom level does not affect the size of the image in PowerPoint
- Resize the image using `Image > Scale`
  - Try both options, using `Scale` or `Width & Height`
  - `[X] Create new window` to keep the original image
  - Check the image calibration before and after the scaling, using `Image > Properties`
  - Explore the different interpolation modes
  - Optionally Check what happens if you copy and paste the resized images into PowerPoint (see above)
