<h4 id="inspect_collagen_data"><a href="#inspect_collagen_data">Inspect collagen image data</a></h4>
-  This activity opens images where tissue culture cells are secreting collagen for different amounts of time.
  The aim is to display the images such that one can appreciate that after 96 h there is more collagen
  secreted than after 0 h. The aim is to make this display as quantitative as possible without doing an actual
  image analysis.
- Requirements:
  - BioVoxxel Fiji Update site for saving images as SVG vector graphics
