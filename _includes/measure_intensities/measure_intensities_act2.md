  - Inspect images where intensity quantification may not be possible

      - Channel 1: Transmission image showing the object location
      - Channel 2: Fluorescence image that should be quantified within the object
        - Appreciate that the signal to noise is very low (CCD noise) and it is hard to decide which background to subtract.
