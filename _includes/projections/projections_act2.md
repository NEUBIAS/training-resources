### How image content affects sum projection
- Open [xyz_calibrated_16bit__golgi_bfa.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_calibrated_16bit__golgi_bfa.tif)
- Sum project along the z axis and determine max value in the projection
- Sum project along the y axis and determine max value in the projection
- How does the image morphology affect the maximum values?
- What would change if maximum projection was used instead?
