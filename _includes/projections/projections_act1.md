- Open [xyz_16bit__spots.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit__spots.tif)
- This 3-D image contains sparse dot-like fluorescence signals
- Observe that viewing the data in 3-D is somewhat challenging
- Perform a maximum projection along the z-axis to "see all spots at once"
- Discuss under which circumstances the number of dots in the projection equals the total number of spots in 3-D
- Also perform a **sum** projection and discuss why this is may be better than a maximum projection in terms of quantifying the total signal contained in the spots
- Understand that the data type of a sum projection typically needs to be "larger" than the input data
- Also learn how to project along the x or y axis
- Understand that projections along the x or y axis typically yield anisotropic images (due to an initial xy/z anisotropy)
- Resample or rescale the x and y projections for correct appearance in physical space
