- Open Fiji
- [ File › Open Samples › Fluorescent Cells ]
- Add a sensible spatial calibration
    - [ Image > Properties ]
    - Set the pixel size to 0.1 micrometer (or so)
- Save as OME-TIFF
    - [ Plugins › Bio-Formats › Bio-Formats Exporter ]
    - File Name: `fluo_cells.ome.tif`
        - It is critical to add the `ome.tif` or `ome.tiff` extension!
    - Files of Type: Due to inconsistent behaviour (e.g., PNG extension is automatically added, OME-TIFF extensions are not added) we recommended not to select anything here, but rather manually specify the respective extension in the "File Name"
    - Observe that there are **useful options**, allowing you to
        - split the image into multiple files
        - compress the image data
- Open the file again in Fiji and check which metadata has been preserved
    - For us, the channel LUTs were not preserved (January 2025)
