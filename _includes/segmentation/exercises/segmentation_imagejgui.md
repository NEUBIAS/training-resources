Open image [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif) and 
1. Find a threshold value so that there are 2 foreground nuclei.
2. Find a threshold value so that only the bright dots remain
3. Find threshold interval so that only the boundary of the nuclei remains.

    
> ## Solution
> **[File > Open...]** [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif)
> **[Image > Adjust > Threshold...]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-T]** opens the threshold menu
> 1. Lower threshold, i.e. upper slider,  at about 5 
> 2. Lower threshold at about 44
> 3. Lower threshold at about 4, upper threshold at about 4-5
