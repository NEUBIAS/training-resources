- `Process › Binary › Options...`
  - `[X] Black background`, because we work with fluorescence data
- Open one of the above images
- `Image › Duplicate...`
  - `Title = binary`
- Draw a line profile to find a good threshold
  - Use the straight line tool in the Fiji menu bar
  - `Analyze › Plot Profile`
    - `Live` and move the line around, including nuclei and background pixels
- `Image › Adjust › Manual Threshold...`
  - `Min = 25`
  - `Max = 255`, because this is the maximum of the image data-type
- `Process › Binary › Convert to Mask`
- `Plugins › MorphoLibJ › Binary Images › Connected Components Labeling`
  - `connectivity = 4`, for no good reason... 
  - `type = 8 bits`, because we will have less than 255 objects
- `Plugins › MorphoLibJ › Analyze › Analyze Regions`
  - You may subset the measurements if you are not interested in all
