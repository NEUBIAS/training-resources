<h4 id='explore3D'><a href="#explore3D">Explore the spatial calibration of a 3D image</a></h4>
  - Open an image and find the spatial calibration metadata
  - Understand that this is important for both rendering and measurements
  - Measure Euclidian calibrated distances in the image
  - Example image: [xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif)
