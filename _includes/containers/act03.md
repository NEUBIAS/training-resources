<h4 id="spots"><a href="#spots">Build your own container</a></h4>
- The previous activities focus on running Docker containers from images, it's useful to understand how these images are created.  
- Sometimes, existing Docker images may not meet your specific needs, they might lack necessary dependencies or require custom configurations. 
- A Dockerfile allows you to create a tailored image by defining exactly what’s inside the container. While we won’t dive deep into writing Dockerfiles, but we’ll briefly touch on why they matter. Having this context will help you better understand the images you’ll be working with. 
- We will perform the following tasks in this activity:
    - Understand the Dockerfile
    - Build from the Dockerfile
